## Description

This is a Web API application that shares and stores data regarding animals of the Cretaceous Period.

This API utilizes pagination to limit the number of results given at a time when a user makes a request to see a list of all animals.

## Setup and Installation Requirements

### Required Technology
* Before starting, check that all required technologies are used. For more information on configuring [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/) and [MySQLWorkbench](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/), follow the links provided.

### Launching and Setting Up the Project
* Navigate to the Cretaceous Api repository [GitHub](https://github.com/sethgonzales/CretaceousApi.Solution).
* Clone the repository down using `$ git clone https://github.com/sethgonzales/CretaceousApi.Solution.git` in your terminal.
* Within the production directory `CretaceousApi`, create a new file called `appsettings.json`.
* Within `appsettings.json`, put in the following code, replacing the `database`, `uid`, and `pwd` values with your own database name, username, and password for MySQL.
```json
{
  "Logging": {
      "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Warning"
      }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=YOUR_DATABASE;uid=YOUR_USERNAME;pwd=YOUR_PASSWORD;"
  }
}
```

### Setting up the database
* If not already configured, install the Entity Framework Core tool `dotnet-ef`Â using the command `$ dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 6.0.0` in your terminal. This will allow for data migrations and updates to the project's database.

### Running the project
* Navigate to this project's production directory `CretaceousApi`.
* Recreate the database by running the command `$ dotnet ef database update` in your terminal.
* Navigate to your MySQLWorkbench to double check that your database has been built without error.
* In the command line, run the command `$ dotnet run` or `$ dotnet watch run` to compile and execute the application.
   * To compile the application without running it, use the following command: `$ dotnet build`.
